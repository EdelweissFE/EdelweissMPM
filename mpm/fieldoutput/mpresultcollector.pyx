        A cdef class for collecting materialPoint results (by using the permanent results pointer (i.e., a numpy array) 
        in large array of all materialPoints and all quadrature points.

        Collecting materialPointal results may be a performance critical part.
        This cdef class allows for the efficient gathering.
        A 3D array is assembled if multiple quadrature points are requested (shape ``[materialPoints, quadraturePoints, resultVector]`` )
        or a 2D array for one quadrature point ( shape ``[materialPoints, resultVector]`` ).
        
        Method :func:`~fe.utils.materialPointresultcollector.MaterialPointResultCollector.getCurrentResults` updates the assembly array and passes it back.
        
        The caller is responsible to make a copy of it, if persistent results are needed!
